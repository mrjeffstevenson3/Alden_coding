## assuming you have installed xcode, xquartz, and xcode command line tools. if not do that 1st
## see detailed instruction here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/
## first get hombrew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install wget
cd ${HOME}; mkdir -p Software; cd Software;
echo "alias cdsw='cd ${HOME}/Software'" >> ~/.bash_profile
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2019.10-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
## The installer prompts “In order to continue the installation process,
## please review the license agreement.” Click Enter to view the license terms.
## Scroll to the bottom of the license terms and enter yes to agree to them.
## The installer next prompts you to Press Enter to confirm the location change it to
## ${HOME}/Software/anaconda3
## The installer prompts 
## “Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?”
## say “yes”
## when done open a new terminal the one you just used is stale
## in new terminal type
conda info  ## and
conda list
# you should see a list installed packages. now we create the pygame environment
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda create --name pygame37 python=3.7
conda activate pygame37
## if this succeeds then add this to your bash_profile so terminal starts here every time ie
echo "conda activate pygame37" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
## and you should see no errors with prompt showing (pygame37)
## now we build up the env so pygame is happy:
wget -O ~/Downloads/SDL2-2.0.10.dmg http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.10.dmg
## Now install SDL2 from disk image
## while that is going on go back to same terminal with prompt showing (pygame37) and paste
conda install numpy pandas pathlib matplotlib seaborn jupyter scipy jupyter
